# ðŸšœBlueBook For Bulldozers

This notebook consist of predicting the bulldozer sales in future by creating the machine learning model based on the bulldozers historical datasets.Since, we are predicting the number so it can be understand that it is a regression related problem. So, for regression problem we use different model:
1. Random Forest Regression
2. Lasso
3. Ridge Regression

After performing some sort of research and understanding the datasets, these models we selected from the [sklearn official documnetation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html).

For performing the data analytics we use some python libraries used for machine learning and data visulisation:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-Learn

Thoughout the notebook we perform these steps to make ourself on track ad achieve our goal:
1. Problem Defination
2. Data
3. Feature
4. Evalutation
5. Modeling
6. Experimentation
